# HackerRank Solutions Repository


## About This Project
Welcome to my personal repository of HackerRank problem solutions! This project is an open collection of my journey solving challenges on the HackerRank platform. While I am neither a math wizard nor the world's best developer, this repository serves as a way to:

- Track my progress and reflect on my learning.
- Improve my coding skills over time by revisiting and refining my solutions.
- Explore alternative solutions or optimizations in the future.

Whether you're here to learn, review, or contribute, feel free to dive in. Collaboration and constructive feedback are always welcome!

---

## Goals
1. **Learn and Improve:** Analyze my mistakes, refine my approach, and grow as a developer.
2. **Collaborate:** Engage with others to explore different perspectives and ideas.
3. **Share Knowledge:** Provide clear and accessible examples for others solving similar challenges.

---

## Repository Structure
Each solution is organized into its own directory with a dedicated README file. Each README provides a detailed explanation of the challenge, input and output formats, and my approach to solving the problem. Here's a quick example of what you can expect:

### Example Challenge Directory
```
plus-minus-ratios/
  |- plus-minus-ratios.js
  |- README.md
```

### Example Challenge README Contents
- **Problem:** Overview of the challenge.
- **Input Format:** Expected input structure.
- **Output Format:** Expected output structure.
- **Examples:** Inputs, outputs, and detailed explanations.
- **Reflection:** My thought process, approach, and what I learned.
